This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Next.js applications that involve dynamic routes and internationalization. The issue occurs when the locale is not correctly passed to pages using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`, resulting in unexpected behavior, particularly 404 errors or the incorrect language being displayed.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected code.  The root cause is often improper handling of the locale within the data fetching functions, leading to either a failure in identifying the user's locale or failing to pass it to components correctly.   The solution involves properly retrieving and utilizing the `locale` parameter from the `context` object within the `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` function.  Ensure consistency between route definitions and how locales are used in these functions.
